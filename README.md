# Technical task web app

1. Create a web app that calculates the area of shapes and visualizes them on screen
2. Use the getDistanceAPI -method from the include.js to get a random distance value for your shapes. 
3. You are free to use libraries as lodash, jQuery, react etc. but we prefer to see as much of your vanilla JS as possible
4. Since this is a task that is intended to run in Chrome, you are free to write ES6 without a transpiler (like Babel)
